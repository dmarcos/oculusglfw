## glfw / Oculus PC SDK Sample code

Code is barebones. Initialization, session creation, swap chain setup, buffer clear logic, frame submission. No proper error handling. Straight path to go from 0 to pixels on screen with glfw and Oculus Desktop SDK (1.35 when this was written)

[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) with compiler (`cl`) available in command line via [vcvarsall.bat x64](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line)
